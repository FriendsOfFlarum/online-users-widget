/**
 * Presence is used purely as an invalidation signal. The server remains the
 * single source of truth for who is online and what may be shown of them.
 *
 * It is tempting to render the presence roster directly — it is, after all, an
 * exact list of who holds a socket right now. But presence membership is the
 * *subscriber* list, and subscribing requires `viewOnlineUsersWidget`. On a
 * forum where that permission is restricted, the roster is not "everyone
 * online", it is "everyone online who may view the widget" — a far smaller set.
 * Treating it as authoritative therefore made the list collapse the moment the
 * socket connected: the page payload counted every recently-active user, then
 * the roster replaced it with the handful of permitted subscribers.
 *
 * The client also cannot filter a roster correctly even when it is complete: it
 * cannot apply the visibility scope, cannot honour the `discloseOnline`
 * preference (the presence payload carries only a display name), and cannot
 * apply the `max_users` cap the `+N` chip is derived from.
 *
 * So membership changes only tell us "something moved, ask again". The rendered
 * list is always the server's answer, which means it never changes definition
 * underneath the viewer.
